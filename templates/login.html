    <p class="question">
        Hey uWu, what is SQL Injection?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        SQL Injection is the act of "injecting" SQL queries to manipulate web applications. These are important to guard against because they
        are an ubiquitous attack on the Interwebs due to their relative simplicity to perform, and the volume of web applications that are
        vulnerable to said attack. SQL Injection attacks thrive on text input fields, which nowadays the majority of websites possess.
        Text input fields are generally connected to a database so that the input can somehow be used to procure some sort of result. One
        would use SQL code to access and compare the input and stored data in the database. If someone typed in SQL code as the input (hence
        "SQL Injection"), it could potentially alter the original SQL query into a malicious one capable of performing whatever action the
        attacker sees fit.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Hmm, interesting. I still don't see how bad SQL Injection can be though.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Giving attackers the potential to gain unparalleled power in YOUR web application? That is terrible and is something that should
        never happen. Though severity varies depending on how the SQL backend code is structured, just the mere thought of a foreign
        entity being able to access YOUR web application, use it to their benefit, and even destroy it should scare you. If you are still
        not convinced, potential consequences of negligence are:

    <p class="question">
        Okay, that sounds pretty terrifying. How do I know if I'll be attacked?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Well, you see, you don't know for sure. But it is likely because again SQL Injection attacks are extremely common on the
        Interwebs. However, there are some factors that will put you more at risk than others (some of which can control, some of
        which you cannot). Some factors that put you at a greater risk are listed below:

                <div class="tooltip">

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Wow. Just wow. Has this attack been successful in years past?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Why, of course! Otherwise, why would we stress the dangers of succumbing to SQL Injection? There have been numerous examples
        down the long roads of history; here are a couple of notable cases that have emerged in (relatively) recent years.

    <p class="question">
        Amazing. Are there different types of SQL Injection attacks or something?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        I'm glad you asked! SQL Injection attacks number very high, and there can therefore be many types of SQL Injection attacks.
        However, we have distinguished three main types for you today: error-based, union-based, and inferential (a.k.a. blind).
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Error-based attacks, huh? Sounds cool. What is it?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">In error-based SQL Injection attacks, the primary goal of the attacker is to flush out weakpoints in the code design by purposefully
        typing in bad input. In doing so, the program may be forced to throw out an error due to a lack of parameter sanization. When this happens,
        the attacker can usually glean information about the program's backend and becomes more knowledgable in hacking the program.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Hmm, I see. What about union-based attacks? Does it use nuclear fusion or something?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Nah, though it would be amazing if there were fusion-powered hacking efforts (or maybe not, depending on your perspective).
        Union-based attacks is all about adding additonal queries to the existing query in the program. This is a very powerful attack if it is not
        caught by the programmer's code it gives the attacker essentially free reign over the application by appending any additional queries the attacker wishes.
        Some possible appendations include: insert, delete, and select.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Muy interesante! The best for last, eh? Tell me about inferential (a.k.a. blind) attacks!
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Inferential SQL Injection attacks are off the premise that the programmer has supressed detailed error messages but has not
        dealt with the underlying issue; only merely hiding it. Attackers no longer have long details from the error, but they can still
        glean information from the little errors that the program will show. Inferential SQL Injection is based off of a series of true/false
        questions. Attackers can input a comparison ('1' = '1') or a time delay ( sleep() function) and they can thereby glean the results
        of these true/false inquiries, procuring knowledge on the program's structure.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Dang. How will I ever be able to stop these attacks? They seem so powerful!
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        SQL Injections can be powerful weapons against those who are negligent and not cautious. But you are not that person anymore
        (no clue if you were to begin with, but doesn't matter!). Because you do not want SQL Injections to have the possible effects
        that they could, here is what you can do to prevent (or at least, lessen the impact of) SQL Injection attacks.
