    <p class="question">
        Hey uWu, what is SQL Injection?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        SQL Injection is the act of "injecting" SQL queries to manipulate web applications. These are important to guard against because they
        are an ubiquitous attack on the Interwebs due to their relative simplicity to perform, and the volume of web applications that are
        vulnerable to said attack. SQL Injection attacks thrive on text input fields, which nowadays the majority of websites possess.
        Text input fields are generally connected to a database so that the input can somehow be used to procure some sort of result. One
        would use SQL code to access and compare the input and stored data in the database. If someone typed in SQL code as the input (hence
        "SQL Injection"), it could potentially alter the original SQL query into a malicious one capable of performing whatever action the
        attacker sees fit.
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Hmm, interesting. I still don't see how bad SQL Injection can be though.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Giving attackers the potential to gain unparalleled power in YOUR web application? That is terrible and is something that should
        never happen. Though severity varies depending on how the SQL backend code is structured, just the mere thought of a foreign
        entity being able to access YOUR web application, use it to their benefit, and even destroy it should scare you. If you are still
        not convinced, potential consequences of negligence are:
        <ul class="answer-list">
            <li>Modify database information (and destroy integrity of your web application!).</li>
            <li>Gain administrative priviledges (and even usurp your throne!).</li>
            <li>Delete entire database tables or corrupt data (sound bad yet?).</li>
            <li>Attack other related online services one provides (and bring your empire crashing down!).</li>
            <li>Procure sensetive information (and now your secrets are exposed!).</li>
            <li>Destroy even backup files (you are so done for... no coming back from this).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Okay, that sounds pretty terrifying. How do I know if I'll be attacked?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Well, you see, you don't know for sure. But it is likely because again SQL Injection attacks are extremely common on the
        Interwebs. However, there are some factors that will put you more at risk than others (some of which can control, some of
        which you cannot). Some factors that put you at a greater risk are listed below:
        <ul class="answer-list">
            <li>Your business is more lucrative to attack (someone would rather attack MasterCard than, let's say, your SoftDev project).</li>
            <li>Your web application is large, but is not updated or patched often.</li>
            <li>There are insufficient checks on invalid user inputs that would prevent nefarious activities on your web application.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="question">
        Wow. Just wow. Has this attack been successful in years past?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Why, of course! Otherwise, why would we stress the dangers of succumbing to SQL Injection? There have been numerous examples
        down the long roads of history; here are a couple of notable cases that have emerged in (relatively) recent years.
